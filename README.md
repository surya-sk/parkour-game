# parkour-game
A Unity project I was working on to mess around with physics and stealth. All of the learning from this project have now been incorporated in the Unreal Engine 5 game I've been working on. 

This was a great project from a learning perspective, and this is unlikely to be a full game. As such, I have decided to stop working on this for the time being.
